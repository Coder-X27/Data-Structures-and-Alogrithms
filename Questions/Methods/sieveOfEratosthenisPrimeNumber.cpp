// IT IS A METHOD TO FIND OUT THE PRIME NUMBER BY SIMPLY MARKING THE PRIME TRUE AT THE POSITIONS WHERE THE STATING NUMBER IS A DIVISOR OF THE OTHER NUMBERS AND THE REMAINING ONES ARE THE PRIME NUMBERS.IT IS A METHOD WHERE WE DONT HAVE TO RUN LOOPS TWICE OR CHECK FOR EVERY ELEMENT ITS TIME COMPLEXITY IS O(logn).//
// METHOD IS KNOWN AS SIEVE OF ERATOSTHENIS
